# The Coin.

_It's a cold day._

_You've been out the entire day._

_If only you could just get a warm meal. But then you see it._ 

_Shining in the wet, grey snow. A coin. Not just any coin. A SIEGE COIN._

**Take a Great look at my project! Made with blood, sweat and tears, along with a mix of gold!**

I hope you enjoy this project!! I had a blast making it!
