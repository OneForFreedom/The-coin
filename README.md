# The lost wishing well.

_You go on a stroll in a mystical forest._

_It's tranquil._

_It's making you happy._

_You take a few more steps further. You stumble upon it.._

_A wishing well? You toss a coin in it and make a wish._

**Take a Great look at my project! Made with blood, sweat and tears, along with a mix of mystic water!**

I hope you enjoy this project!! I had a blast making it!
